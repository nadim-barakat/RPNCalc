%%% this file tests the operations such as <, >, ==, <=, >=
%%%
%%% It also tests edge cases such as comparing Datums 
%%% that are not ints which should throw an error 
%%% 
%%% It also tests cases in which == is called on non ints 
%%% which is a valid operation 
%%%
%%% It also tests calling operations on an empty stack or when 
%%% there is only one thing on the stack 
%%% 
%%% I print after most operations so I can compare with the ref
%%%
